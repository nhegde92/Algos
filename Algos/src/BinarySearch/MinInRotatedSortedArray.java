/*
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0

/*
Note this works for duplicate and non duplicate.
Keep a variable which holds the min value. Check if mid is less then res. Check if low == mid then increment low.
This would help eliminating duplicates. Next do the same thing for high. Now check which side is sorted, pick the
minimum and go to the other side.
